  <h1>Music 270</h1>
  <div> This project began as a trite reflection on the Zoom world we've apocalyptically entered,
     but I ended up falling in love with some of the feedback effects. The process involved programming multiple sample recordings into
     Ableton live which I controlled through my MIDI keyboard. The Zoom feedback was fun, although tricky to figure out. There's definitely a black box element to so much
     of the software we use, end Zoom isn't necessarily interesting in giving you full control over how audio is interpreted or produced.
